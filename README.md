# PMPMEAS: Poor Man's Performance Measurement tool

## Building

To build the software, run ```cmake <path_to_source>``` in the directory where you want to compile the software. Next run ```make```.

### Integrating PMPMEAS in your code

The library provides only four functions to be used in your code:

- ```pmpmeas_init```: Initialise the library
- ```pmpmeas_start```: Start a measurement
- ```pmpmeas_stop```: Stop a measurement
- ```pmpmeas_finish```: Final clean-up and dump of measurements

See examples for how to use PMPMEAS from C, C++ or Fortran in the directory ```src/tests```.

### Using PMPMEAS

The measurements are steered through the environment variable ```PMPMEAS_MEAS_TYPES```. This means that different measurements can be performed using the same binary.

The content of the environment variable has to take the following form: ```<type>[;<type>]...```. Where ```type``` can take the following values:

- ```TIME_BOOT```: Measure time by calling the function ```clock_gettime``` with the clock ```CLOCK_BOOTTIME```
- ```TIME_CPU```: Measure time by calling the function ```clock_gettime``` with the clock ```CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID```
- ```TIME_THRD```: Measure time by calling the function ```clock_gettime``` with the clock ```CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID```
- ```PAPI:<event>[,<event>]```: Use the PAPI low-level interface with ```event``` being the name of an event as shown by ```papi_avail``` or ```papi_native_avail```
- ```PERF:<event>[,event>]```: Use the perf interface with ```event``` being either of the following values (check ```src/include/perfinftypesxx.h``` for possible changes):
  - ```cycles```
  - ```ref_cycles```
  - ```L1_dcache_loads```
  - ```L1_dcache_load_misses```
  - ```L1_dcache_stores```
  - ```LLC_loads```
  - ```LLC_load_misses```
  - ```LLC_stores```
  - ```dTLB_loads```
  - ```dTLB_load_misses```

Some examples:

- ```export PMPMEAS_MEAS_TYPES="TIME_CPU;PAPI=PAPI_L1_DCM,PAPI_L2_DCM"```
- ```export PMPMEAS_MEAS_TYPES="TIME_CPU;PERF:cycles,LLC_loads"```

At the end of each run, the results will be dumped in a file in the local directory with a unique name.
